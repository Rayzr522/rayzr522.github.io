            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>
                I am a young freelance software developer and electronic music producer from America. For the last
                seven years of my life, I have dedicated my life to learning the ins and outs of software
                development, and have tinkered with everything from front-end and back-end web development to game
                development. I have also spent the last year teaching myself how to produce electronic music, and it
                has been a wild adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music and computers are my two main passions, but I also am an experienced graphic designer,
                photographer, and content producer. I also love to work out, stay fit, and push my body to its
                limits. I see every day as a new opportunity to learn and better myself so I can better help those
                around me.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h1>What do I know?</h1>
            <p>
                I've done a little bit of everything, from JavaScript to Java, HTML to Ruby. I have experience in
                over a dozen languages, as well as numerous popular libraries and frameworks, such as <u>Vue</u> for
                front-end web development, <u>Express</u> for back-end web development, <u>Unity</u> for game
                development, and <u>JavaFX</u> for desktop application development, and <u>discord.js</u> for Discord
                bot development to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most recently, I have been experimenting with <u>Python</u>, <u>Crystal</u>, <u>C++</u>, and <u>Go</u>.
                Although I have experience with most of these already, I do not know as much as I would like. I am also
                trying to get better at <u>CSS</u>, as it is a challenge to make user-friendly web experiences that are
                simultaneously beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of specific languages and libraries, I have experience with <u>SQL</u>, managing and planning
                for <u>large projects</u>, and <u>working directly</u> with clients.
